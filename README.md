# **Skill Exchange Platform**

## **Overview**
This repository contains all the files and code for both the front-end and back-end of the Skill Exchange Platform.

## **File Structure**

### **HTML and CSS Files (Front-end)**
- All the files labeled with `.html` (such as **`index.html`**, **`dashboard.html`**, **`profile.html`**, etc.) incorporate the respective HTML and CSS for front-end design and layout. These files are responsible for rendering the user interface, ensuring a clean and responsive experience across various devices.
- The front-end also integrates **extensive JavaScript** for various functionalities such as dynamic user interactions, map services, and form handling, as well as **external API calls** for backend communication.

### **JavaScript Files (Back-end)**
- Our JavaScript code handles the **logic and API integrations** that run on the backend, facilitating **routing**, **data management**, and communication with **external services**. The server-side initialization code is housed within the **server initialization folder**, which includes the **routes for navigating between different pages**.
- In addition, **temporary data**, such as new profile creation and account information, are managed and stored here until they are saved permanently.

### **Backend-Frontend Folder**
- This folder contains all files that link the backend and frontend. The HTML files in this folder (**`index.html`**, **`dashboard.html`**, **`profile.html`**, etc.) incorporate their respective frontend elements, including **CSS for design** and **JavaScript for extensive API integrations** on the backend side.

### **Server Initialization Folder**
- This folder contains all backend **server initialization code**. It is responsible for **routing various pages**, handling **user sessions**, and managing **temporary data** such as profile creation and new account information.

## **Dependencies**
Ensure that the necessary **Node.js modules** and **third-party libraries** for API integrations are installed.
